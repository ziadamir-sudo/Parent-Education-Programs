            <h2 class="paragraph-title">Supporting Your Child to Overcome School Struggles</h2>
            <p>
               Ever felt unsure how to help your child when they are struggling at school?
               <b>You are not alone.</b> Surely all parents dream of seeing their children safe, healthy,
               and successful, hoping for the best for them, but unfortunately, some external factors
               may hinder this dream, one of them is bullying that they may experience. Whether a
               bully or a victim of bullying, supporting your child and helping them overcome their
               mental issues associated with bullying should be every parent’s priority.
               <br><br>
               Unfortunately, not all of us know how to handle the challenges faced by
               our children because of bullying, and some parents themselves may have
               suffered before from bullying and could not solve their problems due to
               the lack of guidance. However, parent education programs have the potential
               to help these parents become more contributing to their children's well-being!
            </p>
            <blockquote>
               "The most effective component of bullying prevention involves family connections such as parent
               psychoeducation,
               seminars, and information specifically about how to communicate with children and schools about
               bullying."<br>

            </blockquote>
            <p>
               Understanding the psychological factors that drive bullying behavior is crucial. Research
               showed that <b>family violence and societal factors increase the likelihood of engaging in
                  bullying</b> among teenagers (Al-Hussein & Shahba, 2024). Hence, family factors play a
               crucial role in influencing children to become bullies, as they bully to gain the appreciation and
               valuation they never had by showing power to others.<br></p>
            <a class="read_more2" href="https://doi.org/10.4314/ajsw.v14i2.3">Read More</a>
            <p><br> This imbalance stems from parents
               and their relation with their children because parents devalue them, or even these
               parents humiliate their children, creating a cycle of violence, as these children
               perceive aggression as the only way to force power on others, internalizing violence
               as a way to exert control. Therefore, bullies start to bully others, affecting their wellbeing.

            <h2>The Importance of Parent Education Programs</h2>
            <p>
               Parent education programs help parents equip them with the needed skills to manage their children's
               problems, develop their empathy, and encourage them to discuss their problems with their parents.
               Children at a young age are not experienced enough to solve their own problems and to respond to
               threats with continuous humiliation or sexual activity. <br><br>They also do not fully trust their
               teachers because their teachers are still not part of their family, raising their concerns about whether
               to
               tell them or not as they are still strangers. So they remain silent and are bullied or start
               bullying others. Training parents on the different situations of bullying and how to handle them
               provides clear guidance for victimized children to overcome their problems. <br><br>For the bullies,
               parent education programs teach these parents how to develop empathy toward other peers so
               that they stop bullying them also these programs resolve conflicts between parents and children,
               building a strong relationship between them and enhancing trust and valuation, resolving the
               psychological problems of these children.

            <p>
               A meta-analysis by Chen et al. (2020) revealed that parenting programs
               led to a <b>significant reduction in bullying behaviors.</b> The home-visiting
               programs included professionals, such as mental health and social professionals
               or specialized trainers who visit families to provide guidance, focusing
               on improving parenting practices, enhancing parent-child communication,
               increasing children’s empathy, and addressing specific family dynamics.<br></p>
            <a class="read_more2" href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1524838020915619">Read More</a><br>
            <p><br>
               These interventions showed higher effects than school anti-bullying
               programs in reducing bullying behavior due to their individualized approach.
               <br><br>
               Another study by Cunha et al. (2023) shows the impact of parental
               involvement in empathy education on reducing bullying by highlighting
               the effectiveness of a low-cost, four-month parental involvement
               program focused on empathy education in reducing bullying. The
               conducted intervention in China that involved 22000 children resulted
               in enhanced parent-child connections and improved children's empathy
               levels, leading to a significant drop in both bullying perpetration
               and victimization.<br>

            <a class="read_more2" href="https://doi.org/10.3386/w30827">Read More</a><br>
            <p><br>
               In addition, this source ensured that it only
               costs $12.50 to prevent a single bullying incident, ensuring the
               potential of parent education programs to be cost-effective solutions
               to address school bullying. This indicates that parent-child connection
               is one of the most effective ways for bullying intervention if they are
               used properly.

            <p>
               Some parents may perceive going to parent education programs shameful because
               they appear to have problems with treating their children, but actually, learning
               how to raise children is part of our learning experience. Even religion educates
               us on how to raise our children and ensure its importance, whether Islam or Christianity.
               So, why is this well accepted while education programs are not? <br><br>It is nature of the
               humans to learn. With today’s advancements, we have more knowledge than ever about
               effective parenting, and this saves time and effort while helping children become
               more productive and resilient, ready to face life's challenges correctly. Or do
               we just accept the fact that we should take the risk in life and let the waves
               of life hit us to learn? We should highlight that <b>prevention is better than cure.</b>
               <br><br>Parent education programs equip parents with the needed tools to resolve the
               conflicts of their children due to bullying. While school anti-bullying programs are
               efficient in doing so, they must be accompanied by better knowledge of parents about
               how to raise their children<br> Remember, <b>you are not alone,</b> and we are all here to help
               you be a better parent that your children will always be proud of!
